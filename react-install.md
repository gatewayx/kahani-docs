## How To Install The Module On React Sites

To install the module on a React application, you can edit your index.html file and add the KahaniJS file:


### Example:
```
<script src="https://cdn.prd.kahaniapp.com/kahani/kahani.js">
```

1. The next step will be to edit the component where you want to show the module and add the kahani module custom element using the code below:


### Example:
```
<kahani-module storyUrl="<LINK_TO_YOUR_CDN>"></kahani-module>
```
The LINK_TO_YOUR_CDN will most likely be autogenerated by the CMS tools so there might not be a need to manually edit this.



At this point the module should be working perfectly, if you would like to customize the module CSS, please see [Customization](customization.md)

!> Customization on React sites, can be done using the use React hooks.

Example:

```
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // customization goes here
}, []);
```
